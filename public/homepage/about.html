          <h4>WHAT IS JUS LEGAL ADVOCATES?</h4>

          <p>
            It is said that 80% of an Advocates job is done at his chamber/office and only 20 % is
            inside the court. This 80% Job consists of some critical yet not may not require
            application of mind and effort. Though most of the times the same may be done with help
            of typists, juniors or clerks, the time spent by them also has a value which can be put
            to better use if some of the work can be automised or digitized. Advocates tend to spend
            time in preparing documents/ pleadings to be filed in court and essentially the filings
            are prescribed a certain format depending on the court and case type. It is very common
            for an advocate to embark into new cases types.
          </p>
          <p>
            This situation requires advocate to look for experts or the court registry to know the
            format required apart from browsing books which may not be readily accessible. This
            process is time consuming and sometimes embarrassing. Another time consuming and often
            harassing experience is numbering the case papers. From spelling in cause title, court
            title, provision of law, court fee, which are checked and corrected causing delay in
            numbering apart from waste of resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jus Legal helps in delivering the document with all required formatting as required for
            a particular case type, it also fills all required mandatory fields based on data input
            provided, with the proper cause title, court title, case type, prayer, provision of law.
            Just ready to add the facts of the case. Facts can also be incorporated in the draft
            (optional) based on instructions provided by advocates. These documents make it easy for
            registry to number the case at the earliest as it avoids common mistakes, thereby making
            it hassle free, saving time, effort and resources apart from saving on paper, thereby
            reducing carbon footprint.
